How to use the FEL-1 Monitor
============================

Run it from the command line with fredii fel.bin. Press F5 to run the debugger.

Select option. These are 0 - run FEL-1 code from $400 A - list code B - change code C - load from tape.

For now try "A"

(the last one doesn't work yet obviously..... no tape and nothing to load into it)

The TV should turn on. (Actually this is wrong, the TV Sync is generated when the TV isn't actually on,
it just doesn't display anything)

The TV should turn on. It's still blank.

Type in the address you want to edit - 3 hex digits (say) 1 1 9

The display should show 0119 with 22 (dec r2), this is the start of the interrupt routine.

Pressing a hex key will change to the next byte.

Pressing F1 resets, ESC exits.

Option B change code works similarly except that you type in the hex bytes rather than
just a key.
